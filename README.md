# CP2-MAD-LIPS

Homework 2

Assignment: For homework, create a set of mad libs -- like your previous choose-your-own-adventure, the first several pages in your mad lib should collect words or other input from viewers, and then the last page should insert those words into a funny paragraph!

Use at least 3 pages to collect at least 8 words. The words can be traditional mad lib categories like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., or they can be whatever you choose. Create your own paragraph for the final page (don't use the one from Wikipedia!), and insert the collected words into it.
